## Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>

MediAI is a website that uses AI technology to predict diseases based on symptoms and guide patients to the best-suited doctors. The platform also features a database where patients can upload their medical records, which can be accessed by doctors via a QR code scan. This document outlines the software requirements for MediAI.

## Problem Statement<a name="problem-statement"></a>

The current healthcare system is often plagued by long wait times, misdiagnosis, and poor communication between patients and doctors. MediAI aims to address these issues by providing patients with accurate predictions of their medical conditions, as well as connecting them with doctors who are well-suited to treat their conditions.

## Overview<a name="overview"></a>

MediAI is a comprehensive healthcare platform that leverages AI technology to improve healthcare outcomes for patients. The system uses predictive analytics to analyze patient data and predict future outcomes, as well as providing a symptom checker, medical records database, and generative chatbot.

## System Overview<a name="system-overview"></a>

MediAI is a web-based application built using modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. The system utilizes AI algorithms to analyze patient data and provide accurate disease predictions. The medical records database is stored in a secure server, and doctors can access the database via a QR code scan.
